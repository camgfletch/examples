#Bet Calculator

This is a project I worked on to help learn PySimpleGUI. I decided to create a calculator for Proportial Staking betting strategy, that helps me determine the value of a bet, and if favourable odds are given determine the size of the bet based on the size of my fund. I have found the tool useful in avoiding unwise bets.

Proportional staking defines the bet stake size based on a percentage of your current bank. As your bank increases, the absolute value of your stakes increase and vice versa for when your bank decreases.
