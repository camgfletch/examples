# NBA

This project is currently a work in progress. Its focus will be the collection and analysis of NBA data.

The first script nba-game-data demonstrates how to extract box score from webpages. The script utilises a small sample, while the complete version of the script will extract data for every game in a season and be able to collate data on a daily basis.
